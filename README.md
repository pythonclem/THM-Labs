# Journeying Through TryHackMe üß†

**`How I Hacked TryHackMe To Hack My Brain (what?)`**
   </br>

## üìú The Why
Every book I read highlights gaps in my knowledge, which I guess is part of the point of reading books to begin with. One big gap in my knowledge in the quest for a first position in the field is practical knowledge of security and research tools. I had heard of Wireshark, of Nmap, Burpsuite, Metasploit and others, knew the theory of the tools, but had never used them. I also wanted to get a taste of what penetration testing is like, since I had a feeling I might enjoy it. Knowing that mastering any tool in a span of two weeks is impossible, I focused on understanding what the different tools can do and on building a raw playbook of "how to approach systems".

   </br>

## üìú The What
TryHackMe is a learning platform with paths, modules, and rooms where learners can get both theoretical and practical knowledge. THM sets up VMs for learners to try and accurately replicate a real world environment and system. The experience is somewhat gamified, with streaks and leveling up. 

   </br>

## üìú The How
Even before signing up, I knew I wanted to dedicate a two week sprint to TryHackMe and try as many rooms and paths as possible. I ended up creating my own study plan according to the gaps I had identified. It included Linux, Windows, and Networking fundamentals, as well as Nmap, Wireshark, Burpsuite, Metasploit and the entire Penetration Testing path. Since I am aiming to pass PenTest+, I figured this would be a good primer on the topic, and indeed it was.

   </br>

## üìú The Challenges
Wanting to pick up chunks of knowledge and experience at lightning speed about something you know little about is one thing - doing it is something else entirely. I was familiar with networking and web concepts, so that part went well since I had the necessary prior knowledge. Privilege esaclation, however, took me about 10 times longer than I would've hoped. On Linux first, then Windows. As usual, nothing worked on the first try, and I had a lot of knowledge gaps I needed to fill before I was able to successfully complete the exercises. You can ask me all you want about SUID bits now. I don't think I'll ever forget what that is.

   </br>

## üìú The Lessons
First, I was highly impressed by the capabilities of the tools and techniques available to test an application or a network‚Äôs defenses. ‚ÄúHacking‚Äù became a lot less of an abstract term, and a lot more practical. I intend to take this knowledge and try and participate in CTF challenges, as an individual and as a team member. I know that finding a group of like-minded individuals to learn from will be a big boost for my learning process. Beyond that, I now have a mini-playbook for the CTFs, based on what I've learned. I'm sure that continuing to build it will be hugely useful for the rest of my career. 

The road ahead may be long and arduous, but I‚Äôm here for it. "Try Harder", right?
