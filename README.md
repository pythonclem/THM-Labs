# Journeying Through TryHackMe 🧠

**`How I Hacked TryHackMe To Hack My Brain (what?)`**
   </br>

## 📜 The Why
Every book I read highlights gaps in my knowledge, which I guess is part of the point of reading books to begin with. One big gap in my knowledge in the quest for a first position in the field is practical knowledge of security and research tools. I had heard of Wireshark, of Nmap, Burpsuite, Metasploit and others, knew the theory of the tools, but had never used them. I also wanted to get a taste of what penetration testing is like, since I had a feeling I might enjoy it. Knowing that mastering any tool in a span of two weeks is impossible, I focused on understanding what the different tools can do to broaden my understanding of the field.

## 📜 The What
TryHackMe is a learning platform with paths, modules, and rooms where learners can get both theoretical and practical knowledge. THM sets up VMs for learners to try and accurately replicate a real world environment and system. The experience is somewhat gamified, with streaks and leveling up.

## 📜 The How
Even before signing up, I knew I wanted to dedicate a two week sprint to TryHackMe and try as many rooms and paths as possible. I ended up creating my own study plan according to the gaps I had identified. It included Linux, Windows, and Networking fundamentals, as well as Nmap, Wireshark, Burpsuite, Metasploit and the entire Penetration Testing path. Since I am aiming to pass PenTest+, I figured this would be a good primer on the topic, and indeed it was.

## 📜 The Challenges
Wanting to pick up chunks of knowledge and experience at lightning speed about something you know very little about is one thing - doing it is something else entirely. While I managed to learn and work with the tools and finished the exercises, I wouldn’t call myself proficient. Wireshark specifically gave me a hard time, and I found it more difficult to pick up than other tools. I feel like I accomplished my goal to familiarize myself with the tools of the trade, and look forward to mastering them with time and repetition.

## 📜 The Lessons
First, I was highly impressed by the capabilities of the tools and techniques available to test an application or a network’s defenses. “Hacking” became a lot less of an abstract term, and a lot more practical. I intend to take this knowledge and try and participate in CTF challenges, as an individual and as a team member. I know that finding a group of like-minded individuals to learn from will be a big boost for my learning process. As I suspected, I enjoyed the challenge of poking and probing a system until it gives in. 

The road ahead may be long and arduous, but I’m here for it.
